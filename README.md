Projects that have a Industrial Application

|Projets|Description|
|--- |--- |
|01. Mall Customer|`Classify a individual into Target or Non-Target so that we can selectively focus on sending personalized campaign to them.` *I have used clustering algorithms to study each features and its relation with the spending pattern of users and then clooectively combined them to differentiate a target user from non target one. The results views from plotlib is amazing as you can rotate the graph to see each feature influence on the classification*|
|02. FashionClassClassification| `With the help of image processing, help an Online retailer to selectively recommend fashion items a person is intrested in.` *I have used Convulation to detect features and then MaxPooling to reduce the feature space and focus only on important features that help me in prediction. Then flattening process was applied to convert the input feature in the required form which was used to train a `Artificial Neural Network` to train and predict.*|
|03. MobileAppSubscriptionAnalysis|`Classify the customer if they belong to "Unlikely" & "Very-Likely" so that we can take corrective action for customer who are likely to end their subscription.`*I have applied various feature transformation techinque to transform response/target variable in order to aid in prediction. I have also derived new featues for the same cause. Then by training data on various machine learning techinque which also include `Voting` and `Stacking` I seperated our target customer from non-target one.*|
|04. MinimizingChurnRateInSubscriptionByFinancialAnalysis| `Do the analysis of data from a Financial mobile app to minimize the churn rate`.|
|05. e-SigningLoanOffersClassification|Analyzing dataset from P2P company to check its users data is good enough to enroll our companies e-signing loan page|
|06. CreditCardFraudDetection|Use of a Neural Network to predict a fraudulent credit card transaction|
